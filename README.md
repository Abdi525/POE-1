README For My Website

This website is for the founders of Tarik Coding School who are teaching younger students at an earlier stage which will help them more if they want to follow an IT career or might wish to just know more about Tech as we are going to see more Tech in our future and life.
Tarik Coding School (TCS) also aims to help those who are currently doing coding related courses but feel like they can't keep up in their classes.
TCS founders has seen how South Africa seems to be behind in some of the worlds Technological advancement and mostly only those in the cities, or those with money have the availabily to tech while there are alot of rural areas who are still in the "olden age".
They made it their mission to make South Africa the world's leading Technological country. One step at a time, one student at a time.
